This document will be filled in further later with a description of the projects, and provide links to the needed files (output for each report/ report generator/ render code/ and maybe more).


This repo is for Samantha Hunter and Evan Patton to house all information for Project 2 for ST-558. The purpose for this project is to predicting the number of shares that an article gets by exploring various learning methods. For each model, we split the data 70%/30%. 70% of the data is used to train our models, and the remaining 30% of the data is used to test the accuracy of the model. For each model, we compared the root mean square error to evaluate how good the model was at prediction. Root mean square error works by taking the squared sums of the differences between the predicted number of shares and the actual number of shares given some values for the response predictors. It is a value we want to be small, which corresponds to having predictions that are numerically close to the actual number of shares.
